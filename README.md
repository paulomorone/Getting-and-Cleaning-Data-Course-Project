# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1 - Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory

2 - Loads all necessaries datasets and rename the column names

3 - Merges the two datasets to create one dataset

4 - Create a new dataset with the mean and SD for each measurement

5 - Descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

6 - Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair

The final tidy file is called Tidy.txt
